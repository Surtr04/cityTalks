<p>It is known as the main house of the Bienal de Cerveira, an art event taking place every two years and that brings contemporary art to the streets and other places in Cerveira. But the Forum is much more than that. It comprises three pavilions. The first houses the Bienal de Cerveira Foundation and its museum, which exhibits pieces of art from the different editions of the Bienal since 1978 until our days. The main mission of the Foundation is precisely to promote contemporary art. Thus, it not only organizes the art Bienal but also keeps a yearly diversified programming and encourages artistic and cultural education.</p>
<p>The second pavilion houses fairs, exhibitions and other events. In the third, there is an auditorium for different shows and performances.</p>
<p>This is also the headquarters of the Bienal de Cerveira Creative Industries Incubator, which includes several rooms, offices and exhibition facilities and that supports very distinct projects – from cinema to visual arts, from handicraft to conservation/restoration.</p>
