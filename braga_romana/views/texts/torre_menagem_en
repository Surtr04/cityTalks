<p>The Menagem Tower is one of the elements of the castle that has survived the transformations across the centuries. It originally had two floors and a gate with a sliding grille, typical on medieval castles. D. Dinis’ shield can be seen on top of the outside door and D. Fernando’s coat of arms on top of the inner door of the tower.</p>
<p>In 1512, when D. Manuel ordered the building of the door barbican, the entrance through the tower was no longer needed and so it was immured. It was opened again in the twentieth century during the requalification works.</p>
<p>In 1844, the Menagem Tower was hit by a lightening. It threatened to collapse and so it was half demolished. By that time, the country was at peace, so the defensive systems had become useless. Some months after the lightening hit the tower, it was decided to fix the paving of Rua do Arrabalde. For that, stones were needed and the municipality decided to use the ones from the tower. The Menagem tower, which is usually the most imposing of the castle towers is, nowadays, the lowest one.</p>
