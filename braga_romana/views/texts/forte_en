<p>This seventeenth century fort was built by the time of the Restoration Wars to reinforce the border defensive system of Cerveira. It would act together with the Castle, the Penedo do Castelinho and the Atalaia de Lovelhe. General D. Francisco de Azevedo, who was also an engineer, ordered its construction. It dates back from somewhere between 1660 and 1662.</p>
<p>The one and only entrance door faces southeast. It comprehends two round arches and a corridor. Inside the fort, in the weapons square, the old barracks, stables, storehouse and chapel, and three access ramps to the embankments can still be seen.</p>
<p>In 1758, almost a century after the Restoration Wars, the square was empty and had no sentry. The barracks and storehouse were ruined. The fort would be used for cattle sheltering.</p>
<p>In 1776, the ramparts went under renovation. The five barracks, including the gunpowder warehouse, had also been reconstructed. The fort of Lovelhe regained military potential, with five to ten permanent soldiers. Some decades later, in 1809, the fort faced its biggest challenge. During the second French invasion, the fort would help to drive away the well trained armies under General Soult. His aim of entering Portugal through the Minho river had failed. He would eventually enter the country through Chaves. When he had the chance, he got his revenge. After invading Portugal, the Napoleonic troops set fire and pillaged several towns. Vila Nova de Cerveira wasn’t an exception. In addition to pillage, the troops exploded the inside of this fort.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century, the fort of Lovelhe definitely lost its military purpose. In 1857, it served as a lazaretto or leprosarium, due to an epidemic.</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, one of the military buildings of the fort was sold. In the thirties, several barracks and other inner buildings were rent to private people. In the eighties and nineties, the fort, now under public control, was subjected to requalification works.</p>
