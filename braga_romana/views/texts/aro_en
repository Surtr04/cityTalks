<p>This is a place with several centuries of history. On the right side, ruins from the Castro cultures of the end of the Bronze Age can be observed. A central street divides two blocks of typical round houses. Each block was owned by a family. Round pits – the silos where food was preserved – are well defined. Those were typical foods of people dedicated both to agriculture and fishing. By the end of the first century, this place underwent deep modifications because of the Romanisation, which reached its peak in the fourth century. The population settled in the area facing the river. The buildings, of Roman style, were more complex: larger houses, built in levels – adapted to the morphology of the land – several rooms and warehouses. Wine, olive oil, traditional Roman tinned fish, among other goods, were kept in the warehouses. Supposedly, there was a wharf on the bank of the Minho river, originally natural and later an artificial one, that allowed this place to work as a trading post. The goods that arrived here were then sent to other places on a regional level. The end of the Roman empire was also the end of the economic heyday, enabled by the trade relations. In the sixth century, the Suebi and Visighotic era began. The buildings of that time were of lower construction quality, aesthetics and durability when compared with the Roman. This archaeological site where we are is, however, the only one in the north of the country that shows different undamaged vestiges of the Suebi-Visigoth times.</p>
<p>It is believed that, from the eleventh century until the Restoration Wars, in the seventeenth century, this place was abandoned. By that time, the Fort of Lovelhe was built on top of the hill. The constructions from the Bronze Age and Roman period were demolished, so that the stones could be reused in the building of the Fort, which would improve the defensive system on the border.</p>
