<p>This building houses the municipal Library. The Solar dos Castros Manor House was originally built in the first decades of the seventeenth century. In 1640, during the Restoration Wars between Portugal and Spain, fire was set to it and it was pillaged, which led to the loss of part of the archives.</p>
<p>The Castros Manor House got its current appearance in the eighteenth century, after the reconstruction works. The main façade, at the centre, displays the baroque heraldic symbol of the Castros, a nobility family from Cerveira. It is a neoclassic two storey urban manor house with a French-style garden on its south side. Graves of different eras found in church squares around the municipality were placed in the garden, among other undated relics, such as a milestone now transformed in a sort of millstone.</p>
<p>The manor house was acquired by the Town Hall in 1972. Between 1997 and 2001, the building was remodelled to house the municipal Library.</p>
