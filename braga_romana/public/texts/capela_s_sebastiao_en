<p>The devotion to Saint Sebastian is widespread around the Minho province. In Cerveira almost all the parishes own an image of Saint Sebastian, the saint that protects from hunger, plagues and war. In the second half of the sixteenth century, Cerveira was attacked by plague. Calvaries were built and prayers were said in honour of Saint Sebastian. During the seventeenth century, by the time of the Restoration Wars, the cult grew. The people from Cerveira, who were in charge of defending the border from the Spanish threat, built a chapel on this site by the Minho river. This chapel is symbolically placed facing Spain, in honour of the protector Saint Sebastian, in hope of divine help.</p>
<p>The exterior simplicity of the chapel contrasts with the magnificence of the image of Saint Sebastian inside.</p>
<p>Despite not being the patron saint of the town, Saint Sebastian is the main entity of the major festivity in Cerveira, which is held on the first week of August.</p>
