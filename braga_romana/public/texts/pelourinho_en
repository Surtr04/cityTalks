<p>The Pillory dates from the sixteenth century, just as the Municipal House. It was built in 1547, according to the inscription on it. The granite pillory is a symbol of municipal jurisdiction and has kept most of its original appearance. Only the golilha – the ring used to hold the neck or hands of the convicted to public punishment – is missing. Allegedly, it was pulled off around 1850. The military recruitment, the reading out of public announcements to population and punishments by flogging used to take place here. The death penalties weren’t carried out here, though, but at the gallows in a visible place outside the castle.</p>
<p>The symbols of the Viscount of Cerveira are to be seen on top of the pillory: the national coat of arms and the symbol of the municipality.</p>
