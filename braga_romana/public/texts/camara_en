<p>Following the signature of the Alcanices Treaty and the establishment of the borders between Portugal and Spain, D. Dinis made several efforts to mark and defend the limits of his reign. He gave Cerveira the first charter in 1321. It was the birth of Vila Nova de Cerveira. D. Dinis let the lands be inhabited, which increased the population of the village there. In 1512, King D. Manuel gave Cerveira a new charter, taking some power from the hands of the local nobility. By that time, the Municipal House must have been built to gather together the good men from Cerveira in assemblies that would dictate the destiny of the town. The prison was next to it. The present layout of the Municipal House dates from the eighteenth century, though, when the baroque heraldic shield was hung on the façade, topped by a royal crown. The piece with the heraldic of the municipality, on the west façade, is from the sixteenth century. It exhibits the back of a deer, on which there is the royal shield displaying seven castles and five smaller shields, known as quinas. On top of the Cross of Christ there is the armillary sphere. As far as it is known, it is the oldest heraldic shield of the municipality.</p>
