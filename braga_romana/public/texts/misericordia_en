<p>The history of this church goes back to the seventeenth century, with the settlement of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia, a brotherhood committed to the poorest. This brotherhood decided to erect in its own building, next to the Town Hall house, a first altar around an image of Ecce Homo, Jesus Christ suffering. As the story goes, the Ecce Homo, probably from the sixteenth century, would have been found buried in the place of Cortes, near the chapel of São Roque, where a Calvary currently stands. It has always been a worship image for believers from this and the other side of the Minho river.</p>
<p>The original chapel wasn’t too large. Due to the number of believers who visited the place, the brotherhood felt the need to extend it. In 1772, after overcoming some financial difficulties, a new and slightly larger chapel was built.</p>
<p>However, the present church, in the transition of baroque and neoclassical, only began to being built in 1811. The brotherhood decided to enlarge it and give it more dignity. Two more altars were built, but the Ecce Homo kept its prominent place. The original Ecce Homo, known as the old Ecce Homo to distinguish it from a more recent image, is to be found in an altar protected by a dome.</p>
<p>In the sacristy there are three planks that were part of the retable of the old temple. On those planks, painted in the 15th century, there is a representation of the encounter by the Golden Door of the Virgin Mary’s parents, Saint Anne and Saint Joachim.</p>
