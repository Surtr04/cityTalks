<p>The Santa Cruz Bastion was built in the seventeenth century and is one of the most well preserved parts of the modern fortress. This bastion defended Viana doors, that´s why a watch tower can still be seen today. It was here that the people who entered the fortress coming from Viana were kept an eye on.</p>
<p>Actually, it is half-bastion. A bastion is nothing more than an advanced defence of the ramparts. It exhibits an octagonal shape similar to an arrow, which favours flanked manoeuvres. In this particular case, we stare at a half-bastion, since it isn’t completely pentagonal shaped.</p>
<p>In 1848, decades after the last armed conflict in Cerveira – the French Invasion – the disputes over the territory and the defence system structures of the town sharpened. The town hall wanted the War Ministry to give up the ramparts in order to stretch the town boundaries. The Ministry eventually agreed to it and the modern fortress began to be destroyed. The Santa Cruz Bastion survived, though. Even private parties started to seize the ramparts lands and embankments often giving way to legal proceedings involving the town hall, the War Ministry and the Civil Governor.</p>
