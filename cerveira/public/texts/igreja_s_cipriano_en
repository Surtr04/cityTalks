<p>The Church of São Cipriano is the Parish Church in Cerveira. It might have been built in the sixteenth century, but there are some evidence that there was a temple there prior to it. The date of the building of the original church is unknown.</p>
<p>The present sanctuary is the outcome of its reconstruction in the nineteenth century, after the storm in 1877. A lightening destroyed the main body of the church, but the top of it resisted. So, the original top of it, with its magnificent gilt work was kept and, due to the growth of the town during the last centuries, the church was enlarged. What can be seen today is a transition of styles between the main body and the top of the church from the sixteenth century to the neoclassical.</p>
<p>The retable, made of national carving, deserves a closer look. It is a magnificent work from the baroque period. Above the altar there are two sculptures. One displays the scene of the Adoration of the Magi and the other the scene of the Final Judgment. They most certainly belonged to old brotherhoods.</p>
<p>The Church of São Cipriano depicts the portrait of a borderline land. Two particular images remind us of the Ways of Santiago: Saint Francis of Assisi, the saint pilgrim, and Saint Christopher, who evokes the hard crossing of the Minho river on barge. The sacred art there shows the marks of both margins of the river. In fact, more serene and obliging images, characteristic of the Portuguese art, contrast with more penitential and filled with suffering ones, proper of Spanish art.</p>
