<p>São Roque das Cortes is said to be the oldest place of worship in town. It was dedicated to the patron saint of the ill and invalids and a protector against plagues. The present building is dated from the sixteenth century according to an inscription on the inside, however it is believed that the original São Roque Chapel had been erected back in the thirteenth century. The tombs found during the repairing works support the idea that the first building belongs to the early Middle Ages.</p>
<p>In the eigtheenth century, it has undergone renovation works. Today, it is a mixture of the fifteenth century and baroque architectures. The vestiges of a Calvary on the wall of the chapel and the frescoes, which, despite the renovations of the eighteenth century, are still seen on the altar, are marks of the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>The altar displays a tiny image of São Roque, probably from the seventeenth century. The two sort of religious floats carrying the images of São Cipriano and Nossa Senhora da Piedade – our Lady of Piety - must also be mentioned.</p>
<p>On the second Sunday of August, there are the São Roque festivities, in honour of the saint, one of the most important religious ceremonies in Cerveira.</p>
