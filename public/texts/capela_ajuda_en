<p>A chapel on the entrance of the town. Was Nossa Senhora da Ajuda protecting this important route? It wasn’t placed there by chance. The Nossa Senhora da Ajuda Chapel, built below the door to the Castle, was connected with the defending of the town for centuries. It dates back to 1650, but the oldest reference to it in official documents is on a judgement from 1634, which shows that, by that time, the temple had a connection to a brotherhood. Actually, it initially belonged to a military brotherhood, but only later did it began to shelter inhabitants. The brotherhood aimed at taking care of injured and ill people and looking after the dead. In 1873, a stone balcony facing the square was built. One year later, another balcony was erected to serve as a pulpit, this time facing the castle. Inside the chapel, plenty of original elements can be found. The very ornamented baroque altarpiece, still influenced by Mannerism, is worth mentioning. There is an image of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda on the central tribune. On the ceiling several paintings dedicated to the patron saint can be contemplated. The giltwork decoration is dominated by vegetable ornaments, a characteristic of the seventeenth century.</p>
