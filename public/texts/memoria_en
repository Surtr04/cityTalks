<p>It is a commemorative monument of the victories in the Peninsular War, but, more than that, it is a symbol of the resistance of the people from Minho. On the fifteenth February 1809, the French troops under the command of General Soult tried to enter Portugal through Cerveira across the Minho river. Due to the bravery of the local people, the French troops had to retreat and invaded the country through the border in Chaves, Trás-os-Montes.</p>
<p>The Memory was erected in honour of all the heroes of the Peninsular War, but among these, one is worth mentioning: the 77-year-old veteran colonel Gonçalo Coelho de Araújo. It was him that organised the frontier defensive weapons and militias next to this town when the French had already got the support from the fortress of Goyan, Galicia, on the other bank of the river. From the Spanish side, there was a highly professional, trained and well armed soldiers. From the Portuguese side, there was a population with only three cannons – the ones left from the Restoration Wars – and basic training, but very brave. By some miracle, the people from Cerveira were able to stop the invasion of the French army.</p>
<p>A woman, Resina, also showed a bold attitude. She was the Governor of the fort of Lovelhe’s wife. She was aware of the presence of the French troops at the fortress of Goyan, right opposite the fort of Lovelhe. She stood in her underwear and told the artilleryman to load the cannon and aim it at Goyan. The shot destroyed the corner of the manor house where the French were. These eventually fled from the place frightened of being hit again.</p>
<p>The first stone of this monument was laid a hundred years later, on the 15th February 1909. Some months later the first Memory monument was inaugurated with great pomp and an outdoor Mass, a procession and music. The relevance of the Memory monument clearly shows the respect and pride felt by the people from Cerveira for their past.</p>
